      Kwame Nkrumah was a Ghanaian politician and revolutionary. He was the
      first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to
      independence from Britain in 1957. An influential advocate of
      pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organisation of
      African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. After twelve
      years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political
      philosophy and organising with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah
      returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of
      national independence. He formed the Convention People's Party, which
      achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common
      voter. He became Prime Minister in 1952 and retained this position when
      Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957. In 1960, Ghanaians
      approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President. His
      administration was both nationalist and socialist. Thus, it funded
      national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national
      education system and promoted a national and pan-African culture. Under
      Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations
      during the decolonisation period. Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 by the
      National Liberation Council which under the supervision of international
      financial institutions privatised many of the country's state
      corporations. Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, of which he
      was named honorary co-president.
